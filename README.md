This is a minimalist project that aims to replicate the functionality of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), with an emphasis on the Cyberpunk aesthetic. Ensure that you have purchased a license for any font that you wish to use commercially.

Contribute any other fonts that you think would be a good addition to this project!

## Ideas
- Presets for high res, nav bar size, and favicon size
- Integrate my 8-bit fork for unique looks
- Stenography image marking with [this](https://codingshiksha.com/javascript/build-a-image-steganography-project-to-hide-text-in-images-in-html5-vanilla-javascript-full-project-for-beginners/) or [this](https://expobrain.net/2014/09/26/hide-javascript-code-into-images/)
